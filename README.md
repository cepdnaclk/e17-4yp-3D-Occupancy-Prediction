# 3D Occpuancy Prediction for End-to-End Autonomous Driving
___

In the field of autonomous driving, accurate representation of the 3D space surrounding the vehicle is crucial for various tasks such as prediction, planning, and motion control. While lidar-based approaches have been used for precise 3D object detection, they have limitations in terms of cost and sensitivity to adverse weather conditions. As a result, achieving reliable and accurate 3D perception using only one or multiple RGB images has become the **holy grail** for autonomous driving. Additionally, temporal reasoning, along with spatial reasoning, plays a vital role in autonomous driving models. Therefore, our project aims to combine the strengths of various approaches to **develop a vision-based End-to-End autonomous driving model** that can compete with existing architectures. However, our **primary goal during the FYP is to _focus on 3D occupancy prediction that can enhance downstream driving and vision tasks_**.
